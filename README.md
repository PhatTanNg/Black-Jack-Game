How to Play
Objective: The objective of Blackjack is to get a hand total closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21.
Players: You can play with 2 to 4 players, including the dealer.
Dealing: Each player, including the dealer, is dealt two cards initially.
Player Turns: Players take turns to decide whether to "Hit" (get another card) or "Stand" (keep the current hand). Players can also choose to "Split" if they have two identical cards or a card with a value of 10.
Dealer's Turn: After all players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals their hand and draws additional cards until their total is 17 or higher.
